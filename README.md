## Lost in the Capitol
Your friends in the Computer Science department have been complaining to you that DC is confusing to get around. Due to the high cost of their mobile plan's data rates, they can’t use map programs like Apple Maps or Google Maps. They've asked you to build a program that tells users where in DC they are compared to some landmarks that they know. Your task is to build a program which tells user's their relative location to some set places. You should:

Ask the user to input their latitude and longitude.
Tell the user if they are North of K St. or South of it.
If they are North of the White House print “You are north of the White House”. If they are south of the white house print “You are south of the White House”. If they are neither, don’t print anything.
If they are west of the White House print “You are north of the White House”. If they are south of the white house print “You are south of the White House”. If they are neither, don’t print anything.
Do the same thing with Downing Hall, Dupont Circle, and Union Station
 

Your code should look like this (user input is for Greene Stadium and is in bold):

Insert your latitude: 38.9255998

Insert your longitude: -77.0234159

You are north of K St

You are north of the White House

You are east of the White House

You are north of Downing Hall

You are west of Downing Hall

You are north of Dupont Circle

You are east of Dupont Circle

You are north of Union Station

You are west of Union Station

 

For Extra Credit: Print out the distance in miles from Downing Hall to that location (rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile). For example, if the user is at Greene stadium, the program should print out:

You are 0.2 miles from Downing Hall

You may assume one degree of longitude is 53 miles in DC
